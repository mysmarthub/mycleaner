Description:
------------
A package of modules and console utilities for shredding,
erasing, and deleting files.

With this package, you can develop graphical,
console , and cross-platform applications to shredding,
erasing , and deleting files
so that they are difficult or impossible to recover.

You can also use a ready-made console utility for destruction,
reset and delete files - mycleaner.py

The utility allows you to shred files,
erase files, for complete or partial difficulty
their recovery after removal.

Be careful! When adding folders, all files from all subfolders
will be added recursively.

We recommend that you run the program on Linux, mount the disks,
and work with them, because then you will have access to
the destroy method with the function of overwriting files.

--------------------------------------
Launch and use the ready-made utility:
--------------------------------------
    - After installation, you can run the utility using its name.
        mycleaner --help

    - See the help page to understand how to work with the utility

      mycleaner.py -y -dd shred /path/ /path2/ /pathN/file.file -n 100

`sudo pip install mycleaner`

`sudo mycleaner -y -dd shred /path/ /path2/ /pathN/file.file -n 100`

`sudo mycleaner -y -dd erase /path/ /path2/ /pathN/file.file`
