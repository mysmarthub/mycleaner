Description:
---
- A package of modules and console utilities for destroying,
zeroing, and deleting files.

- With this package, you can develop graphical,
console , and cross-platform applications to destroy,
reset data in a file, and delete files
so that they are difficult or impossible to recover.

- You can also use a ready-made console utility for destruction,
reset and delete files.

- The utility allows you to destruct files,
reset them to zero and delete them,
for complete or partial difficulty in
restoring them after deletion.

- Be careful! When adding folders, all files from all subfolders
will be added recursively.

      My Cleaner - CLI utility for destroying, zeroing, and deleting files.
    
      PATHS - these are the paths to files and folders with files separated by a
      space, if there are spaces in the path name, escape them, or put them in
      quotation marks.
    
      - Console utility for destruction, zeroing, and deleting files.
    
      - The utility allows you to destruct files, reset them to zero and delete
      them, for complete or partial difficulty in restoring them after deletion.

    Options:
      -v, --version      Displays the version of the program and exits.

                         specify it, the program will start and start destroying
                         files automatically.
    
      -n, --num INTEGER  Number of overwrites. If you use the shred method, each
                         file will be overwritten the specified number of times
                         before being destroyed.
    
      -s, --shred        Overwrites random data, renames and deletes the file,

Use:
---

Package installation:

`pip install mycleaner`

To create applications:

```python
from mycleaner import smart, cleaner
```

Launch and use the ready-made utility:

    - After installation, you can run the utility using its name.
        mycleaner

    - See the help page to understand how to work with the utility

    - After the name, specify the paths to files and folders separated by a space,
        on some systems if the path contains spaces or others
        forbidden characters, and the system itself does not escape such a path,
        either escape such a path or enclose it in quotation marks.
        mycleaner /path1 /path2 /pathN/file.file

    - Next, you should specify the method for the utility to work. At the moment
        there are 4 methods available: --shred, --zero, --del, --test.
    --shred: [destroy] - overwrites and deletes the file.
    --zero: [zeroing] - completely destroys the information inside the file,
        but does not delete the file.
    --del: [delete] - First applies [zeroing], then deletes the file.
    --test: [test] - Running the program in test mode, no
        files or folders will not be deleted
    mycleaner /path1 /path2 /pathN/file.file --shred

    - When using the method --shred ([destroy])
        you can specify the number of file overwrites
        using the parameter --num 100 или -n 100,
        with any number separated by a space.
    mycleaner /path1 /path2 /pathN/file.file --shred -n 30

    - To delete empty folders after work, use the parameter --del-dirs или -dd

    - You can also run the utility in automatic execution mode
        (for example, use it to start and run at a certain time
        using the task scheduler). To do this, you should send an additional message
        the --yes or-y parameter. Be careful using this parameter,
        after all, the utility will start working automatically.

        To start automatically, you must pass all the necessary parameters:
            be sure the existing path, and the method (if you do not pass default
            [destroy] is triggered, and the --yes or-y parameter is used.
            The parameters -dd and --num can be used as desired.
        mycleaner /path1 /path2 /pathN/file.file --shred -n 30 -dd -y
